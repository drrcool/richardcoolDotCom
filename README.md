# richardcoolDotCom
a redo containing my website source

## The purpose

My personal website (richardcool.com) is a landing page and advertising page for me when I'm on the job market or to share my thoughts and ideas.  I have no illusions it getting much traffic.  For now, it is hosted for free with Netlify. (TODO: link).

The stack used in v1 of the app is Typscript + NextJS (I have history with React + JS + some Redux so this isn't too different). Styling is being doing with TailwindCSS. Which, so far, has been a lot of fun.  

Current status:

In breaking the rules, I designed in Figma a rough layout -- but desktop first.  I now see my design will be horrible on mobile, so for now I am getting copy into the markup and making markup. I will style more as I go but I am ready for some mobile layouts too. 

A lot of content is still placeholder.


### Ideas:
------------
1. Animated SVG 
2. Animated Menus (jelly to show active tab)
3. Some chart / dashboard examples.  I can't show my stuff from work but can do some work and show something in the same spirit but using differnet data
4. Some storytelling examples.  A reactive data story is always compelling and can teach far better than a talk.
5. Theming (I want to do this for work)
6.
